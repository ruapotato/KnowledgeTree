# KnowledgeTree - A Context-Aware Knowledge Graph

KnowledgeTree is a web application for building hierarchical knowledge bases. Unlike a standard wiki, KnowledgeTree understands the full context of any piece of information within its hierarchy. It allows users to export a complete "context stack" that includes not only an article's direct lineage but also all sibling articles and content from linked folders. This is designed for piping rich, layered, and comprehensive context into AI tools and APIs.

It uses a familiar, intuitive file-manager interface for organizing knowledge and can automatically populate itself with data from external services like Freshservice and Datto RMM.

## The Context Engine ‚ú®

The core of KnowledgeTree is its ability to generate a complete contextual snapshot for any article with a single click. When you export the context, you get a clean, markdown-formatted document containing:

-   **Full Ancestry**: Content from every article in the direct path from the root to the parent of your current location.
    
-   **Complete Sibling Data**: The content of all "brother and sister" articles that share the same parent folder, at every level of the hierarchy.
    
-   **Attached Folder Content**: Information from special "attached" folders is seamlessly included as if it were part of the parent folder's main content.
    
-   **File Attachments**: A list of any files attached to the specific article you are viewing.
    

This process ensures that when you provide the context to an AI, it has all the relevant information from the entire knowledge structure, not just a single article.

## Features

-   **Automated Data Sync**: Automatically pulls in and structures company, user, and asset data from **Freshservice** and **Datto RMM**, creating a single source of truth.
    
-   **Rich Text Editor**: A beautiful WYSIWYG editor that makes writing feel natural, with a "Markdown" tab for power users.
    
-   **Intuitive File Management**: Organize articles and folders with a classic file-browser interface, including single-click to select, double-click to open, and a full right-click context menu.
    
-   **Attached Folders (Context Linking)**: Create special "paperclip" folders that link context from one part of the tree to another, allowing for organized, reusable information.
    
-   **File Attachments**: Upload and attach relevant files and images to any knowledge article.
    
-   **Admin Panel**: Includes tools to wipe the database, manage data puller settings, and manually trigger sync jobs.
    
-   **API-Driven**: A clean JSON API for data retrieval and manipulation, ready for integration with other systems.
    

## Automated Data Sync

KnowledgeTree includes scripts to keep your knowledge base up-to-date automatically:

-   **Freshservice Sync**:
    
    -   Pulls all companies and active users from Freshservice.
        
    -   Creates a folder for each company under `/Companies/`.
        
    -   Inside each company folder, it creates a `/Users/` directory and populates it with a folder for each user, containing a `Contact.md` file with their details.
        
-   **Datto RMM Sync**:
    
    -   Pulls all devices from sites in Datto RMM that have a custom `AccountNumber` variable.
        
    -   Creates a general `/Assets/` folder in each matching company's directory.
        
    -   Creates a Markdown file for each device in the `/Assets/` folder with detailed information.
        
    -   If a device's name or description matches a user, it also creates a link to the asset file in that user's folder.
        

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

-   **Backend**: Flask (Python)
    
-   **Database**: Neo4j (Graph Database)
    
-   **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, Toast UI Editor, FontAwesome
    
-   **Scheduler**: `schedule` library for running background jobs.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ruapotato/KnowledgeTree
    cd KnowledgeTree
    
    ```
    
2.  **Create Environment & Install Dependencies:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    python3 -m venv pyenv
    source ./pyenv/bin/activate

    ```
    
3.  **Setup Neo4j:**
    
    -   Follow the official instructions for your OS. For Ubuntu:
        
        Bash
        
        ```
        # Add Neo4j GPG key and repository
        wget -O - https://debian.neo4j.com/neotechnology.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
        echo 'deb https://debian.neo4j.com stable 5' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/neo4j.list
        
        # Install Neo4j and required Java version
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install neo4j openjdk-17-jdk -y
        
        ```
        
    -   Configure `JAVA_HOME` by adding `export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64` to your `~/.bashrc`.
        
    -   Start the Neo4j service (`sudo systemctl start neo4j`).
        
    -   Set the initial password by running `cypher-shell -u neo4j -p neo4j` and following the prompts.
        
4.  **Create `.env` file:** In the project's root directory, create a `.env` file and add your credentials and API keys for Neo4j, Freshservice, and Datto RMM.
    
5.  **Run the application:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    flask run --port=5001
    
    ```
    
6.  **(Optional) First Run / Reset:** Navigate to `/admin` to wipe the database for a clean start. Then, go to `/admin/settings` to trigger the initial data syncs.
